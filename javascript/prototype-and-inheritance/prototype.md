# Prototypes & Inheritance

In JavaScript, prototypes are the foundation of inheritance. Every object in JavaScript is linked to another object called its prototype. This forms a prototype chain that enables inheritance and shared methods across multiple objects.

## 1. What is a Prototype?

A prototype is an object from which other objects inherit properties and methods.
Every JavaScript object has an internal link to its prototype (**proto**).

## 2. Prototype Chain

When accessing a property on an object, JavaScript looks for the property on the object itself.
If not found, it searches up the prototype chain until the property is found or the chain ends at null.

That prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with null as its prototype. By definition, null has no prototype and acts as the final link in this prototype chain. It is possible to mutate any member of the prototype chain or even swap out the prototype at runtime, so concepts like static dispatching do not exist in JavaScript.

There are several ways to specify the [[Prototype]] of an object, which are listed in a later section. For now, we will use the **proto** syntax for illustration. It's worth noting that the { **proto**: ... } syntax is different from the obj.**proto** accessor: the former is standard and not deprecated.

In an object literal like { a: 1, b: 2, **proto**: c }, the value c (which has to be either null or another object) will become the [[Prototype]] of the object represented by the literal, while the other keys like a and b will become the own properties of the object. This syntax reads very naturally, since [[Prototype]] is just an "internal property" of the object.

```js
const o = {
  a: 1,
  b: 2,
  // __proto__ sets the [[Prototype]]. It's specified here
  // as another object literal.
  __proto__: {
    b: 3,
    c: 4,
  },
};

// o.[[Prototype]] has properties b and c.
// o.[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]] is Object.prototype (we will explain
// what that means later).
// Finally, o.[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]] is null.
// This is the end of the prototype chain, as null,
// by definition, has no [[Prototype]].
// Thus, the full prototype chain looks like:
// { a: 1, b: 2 } ---> { b: 3, c: 4 } ---> Object.prototype ---> null

console.log(o.a); // 1
// Is there an 'a' own property on o? Yes, and its value is 1.

console.log(o.b); // 2
// Is there a 'b' own property on o? Yes, and its value is 2.
// The prototype also has a 'b' property, but it's not visited.
// This is called Property Shadowing

console.log(o.c); // 4
// Is there a 'c' own property on o? No, check its prototype.
// Is there a 'c' own property on o.[[Prototype]]? Yes, its value is 4.

console.log(o.d); // undefined
// Is there a 'd' own property on o? No, check its prototype.
// Is there a 'd' own property on o.[[Prototype]]? No, check its prototype.
// o.[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]] is Object.prototype and
// there is no 'd' property by default, check its prototype.
// o.[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]] is null, stop searching,
// no property found, return undefined.
```

```js
const o = {
  a: 1,
  b: 2,
  // __proto__ sets the [[Prototype]]. It's specified here
  // as another object literal.
  __proto__: {
    b: 3,
    c: 4,
    __proto__: {
      d: 5,
    },
  },
};

// { a: 1, b: 2 } ---> { b: 3, c: 4 } ---> { d: 5 } ---> Object.prototype ---> null

console.log(o.d); // 5
```
